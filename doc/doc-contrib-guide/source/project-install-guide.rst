Installation Guides
===================

Pike and later
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each official OpenStack project should maintain an installation guide
following the layout described in :doc:`project-guides`. When the guide is
available, update ``openstack-manuals/www/project-data/latest.yaml`` to include
information about the project and ensure that the
``has_install_guide`` flag is set to ``true`` to ensure that the guide
is listed along with the guides from other projects.

Newton and Ocata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Newton and Ocata releases only, big tent projects created their own
installation guides, based on a standard template, in their own repository.
These guides were then centrally published to
`docs.openstack.org <https://docs.openstack.org>`_.

.. warning::

   The following instructions are superseded by :doc:`project-guides`. New
   installation guides should be created using the layout defined in the spec,
   rather than the following instructions.

Set up project specific installation guides:

#. Install ``cookiecutter``:

   .. code-block:: console

      # pip install cookiecutter

#. Run the Install Guide cookiecutter in the top-level directory of your
   projects repository to create a skeleton for the install guide of your
   project:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ cookiecutter https://opendev.org/openstack/installguide-cookiecutter.git

   You will be prompted to answer the following questions to complete the
   installation:

   .. list-table::
      :header-rows: 1

      * - Parameter
        - Explanation
        - Example

      * - directory_name
        - The name of the install guide directory inside the project repository.
          This should be, ``install-guide``.
        - install-guide

      * - service
        - The service name what the project implements.
        - Compute, Telemetry Alarming, or Root Cause Analysis

      * - codename
        - The name how the different components of the project are refering to the project
        - nova, aodh, or vitrage as in nova-conductor or vitrage-api

   A directory will be created with the name that was defined in
   ``directory_name`` (usually ``install-guide``) with the skeleton
   of the install guide.

#. Create a ``tox.ini`` environment for ``install-guide`` in your project
   repository, using this content:

   .. code-block:: ini

      [testenv:install-guide]
      whitelist_externals = rm
      commands =
              rm -rf install-guide/build
              sphinx-build -a -E -W -d install-guide/build/doctrees -b html install-guide/source install-guide/build/html

#. Add the python package ``openstackdocstheme``  to the
   ``test-requirements.txt`` file. Copy the exact requirement line from the
   `global file
   <https://opendev.org/openstack/requirements/src/branch/master/global-requirements.txt>`_:

   .. code-block:: none

      openstackdocstheme>=1.5.0  # Apache-2.0

#. Add your installation content, and test the build locally with ``tox``:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ tox -e install-guide

   The local build will be generated in the ``install-guide/build/html``
   directory".

#. Commit the changes to your project repository for review.


After these changes have merged, you can set up the jobs for building.

#. Clone the ``project-config`` repo:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone https://opendev.org/openstack/project-config

#. In ``jenkins/jobs/projects.yaml``, add ``install-guide-jobs`` within the
   entry for your project:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      - project:
          name: heat

          jobs:
          ...
           - install-guide-jobs:
               service: orchestration

   Here ``service`` is the service name of the project, like orchestration
   for heat.

   This defines the jobs using the JJB ``install-guide-jobs`` job-template.

#. In ``zuul/layout.yaml``, locate the entry for your project and add the
   ``install-guide-jobs`` template:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      - name: openstack/heat
        template:
          - name: install-guide-jobs

   This schedules the Install Guide jobs.

#. Commit the changes to the infra repository for review.
