Blueprints and specifications
=============================

The Documentation team uses specifications in the `docs-specs repository
<https://opendev.org/openstack/docs-specs>`_ to maintain large
changes. Approved specifications are published at `Documentation Program
Specifications <https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/docs-specs>`_.
For tracking purposes, a blueprint is created for each specification.

Use blueprints and specifications:

* For any large reorganization of a deliverable or set of deliverables.
* For infrastructure or automation work that needs to be designed prior to
  proposing a patch.
* When adding an entirely new deliverable to the docs project.
* When adding large sections to an existing document to ensure involvement
  of the docs core team.
* For any work that requires both content and tooling changes, such as
  addition of the API reference site.
* For work that should definitely be discussed at a project teams gathering.

A specification needs two +2 votes from the docs core team. See the current
list of `docs core team members
<https://review.opendev.org/#/admin/groups/30,members>`_.

Use bugs against a particular repository with documentation:

* For known content issues, even if you have to do multiple patches to close
  the bug.
* To add content that is just missing.
* For known errors in a document.
