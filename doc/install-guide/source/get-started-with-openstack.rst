Get started with OpenStack
==========================

The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform for all
types of clouds, which aims to be simple to implement, massively
scalable, and feature rich. Developers and cloud computing technologists
from around the world create the OpenStack project.

OpenStack provides an :term:`Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)` solution
through a set of interrelated services. Each service offers an
:term:`Application Programming Interface (API)` that facilitates this
integration. Depending on your needs, you can install some or all
services.

======================

The
`OpenStack project navigator <https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components>`_
lets you browse the OpenStack services that make up the OpenStack architecture.
The services are categorized per the service type and release series.
