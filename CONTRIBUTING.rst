How to contribute
=================

Our community welcomes all people interested in open source cloud
computing, and encourages you to join the `Open Infrastructure Foundation
<https://openinfra.dev/join>`_.

The best way to get involved with the community is to talk with others
online or at a meet up and offer contributions through our processes,
the `OpenStack wiki <https://wiki.openstack.org>`_, blogs, or on IRC at
``#openstack`` on ``irc.oftc.net``.

We welcome all types of contributions, from blueprint designs to
documentation to testing to deployment scripts.

If you would like to contribute to the documents, please see the
`OpenStack Documentation Contributor Guide
<https://docs.openstack.org/doc-contrib-guide/>`_.

If you would like to contribute to the development of OpenStack, you must
follow the steps in this page:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html

If you already have a good understanding of how the system works and your
OpenStack accounts are set up, you can skip to the development workflow
section of this documentation to learn how changes to OpenStack should be
submitted for review via the Gerrit tool:

   https://docs.opendev.org/opendev/infra-manual/latest/developers.html#development-workflow

Pull requests submitted through GitHub will be ignored.

Bugs should be filed on Launchpad, not GitHub:

   https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack-manuals
